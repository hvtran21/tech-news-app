# tldr_techapp
App envisonment of tldr_newsletter but in an app. 

## Why?
The tldr_newsletter is only through emails, and for me it was overflowing my inbox and I was not a fan, it made finding everything else harder that I conisdered important.

## Solution
Make a mobile application that can display all of the information in a comfortable format, that doesn't overflow inboxes. Most the time we'll read it from our phone, or others at the computer; both can be used. It's just that on the phone, its just easier and more convient. No more flooded inboxes, we already recieve enough emails.

### Features
&rarr; Have an associated account (optional) that marks a reading list and saves preferences \
&rarr; Easy, intuitive format, and good format for reading that is comfortable for the reader \
&rarr; Save potential bookmarks for a user to keep on reading at another time \
&rarr; Add AI features, where a user can select an option to summarize the article? Not too sure on the feasibility with this. \
&rarr; Send notifications of the arrival of new articles \
&rarr; Add a widget that shows a new hot article to read, preference defined by the user

## Initial Support
I want to initially support mobile applications, focusing on iOS development and open to expanding to other mobile operating systems such as Android.
